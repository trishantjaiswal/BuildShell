# 🐚 BuildShell — A Mini Unix Shell in C++
**A lightweight, feature-rich Unix-like shell built from scratch in C++ using system calls, readline, and a lot of curiosity.**

BuildShell is a custom command-line shell that supports execution of system programs, built-in commands, pipelines, redirection, history management, and tab completion. It is designed to explore how real shells like bash and zsh work under the hood.

---

## Features

### Core Shell Features
- Execute external programs using `fork()` + `execv()`
- PATH resolution for commands
- Built-in commands support
- Robust command parsing with quotes and escapes

### Built-in Commands
- `cd` — change directory
- `pwd` — print working directory
- `echo` — print arguments
- `exit` — exit shell safely
- `type` — identify command type
- `history` — command history management

### Redirection
Supports:
- `>` redirect stdout
- `>>` append stdout
- `2>` redirect stderr
- `2>>` append stderr

```bash
echo hello > out.txt
ls 2> err.txt
```

### Pipelines
Chain commands like a real shell:
```bash
ls | grep cpp | wc -l
```

### Command History
- Persistent history using `HISTFILE`
- Load history on startup
- Append history on exit

Options:
```
history -r file
history -w file
history -a file
```

### Smart Tab Completion
- Executables from PATH
- Built-in commands
- Longest Common Prefix completion
- Double-TAB to list suggestions

### Quote Handling
- Single quotes
- Double quotes with escapes
- Backslash escaping

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lambo-IITian/Shell.git
cd Shell
```

2. **Compile**
```bash
g++ main.cpp -lreadline -o buildshell
```

3. **Run**
```bash
./buildshell
```

## Learning Goals

This project explores:
- How shells interpret commands
- Process creation and management
- File descriptor manipulation
- Pipes and IPC
- Environment variables and PATH resolution
- Terminal interaction using readline

---

## Example Usage

```bash
$ echo "Hello Shell"
$ cd ..
$ pwd
$ ls | grep .cpp
$ history
$ type ls
```

---

## Future Improvements

- Job control (`fg`, `bg`, `jobs`)
- Signal handling
- Environment variable expansion
- Globbing
- Aliases
- Scripting support
